## Shared conventions

This file is the agent-agnostic source of truth (per the
[agents.md](https://agents.md) convention). The matching
`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` files are thin shims that point back
here so each tool's auto-load behaviour still finds something.
**Edit AGENTS.md, not the shims.**

### Git workflow

- **No direct push to `main`.** Open a PR.
  - Exception: trivial typo / whitespace / docs wording fixes.
- Branch names: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`.
- **PR titles + bodies in English. Commit messages in English.**
- **Releases are PR-driven and tagging is automatic** — in repos that
  ship a release pipeline. Bump the version in the project's own
  manifest in a `chore/release-vX.Y.Z` PR; on merge to `main` the
  language layer's `auto-tag.yml` detects the bump, pushes the
  `vX.Y.Z` tag, and that tag is what fires `release.yml`. **Do not run
  `git tag` by hand** — the bot tag will collide and the manual push
  fails. The specifics belong to the layers shipping those two
  workflows, which are not the same layer: `kata:agents:rust:*` for
  which file holds the version and for `auto-tag.yml`,
  `kata:agents:rust-{cli,lib}:*` for what `release.yml` builds and
  publishes. A repo with no `auto-tag.yml` has no release pipeline at
  all: nothing tags, and the version field in its manifest may well
  be decoration.

### Pre-merge review

Review happens **before the pull request, on the operator's machine**,
via [magi](https://github.com/yukimemi/magi). This layer no longer
ships PR-side review bots: `claude-review.yml` and `claude.yml` were
removed from it. Their scope was
human-authored PRs — their own job-level `if:` already excluded
`chore/release-*`, `kata-apply/auto`, `apm-bump/auto` and
Renovate / Dependabot — which is exactly the set magi reviews, so
keeping them meant reviewing the same diff twice, a
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret per repository, Actions minutes on
private repos, and one trap that silently cost reviews: a PR editing
either workflow was skipped by `claude-code-action`'s
workflow-validation check and merged with a green check and no
review attached.

**"Removed" is a statement about this template layer, not about
every repo's current state.** Dropping a `[[file]]` entry stops kata
from managing the rendered file — it does not delete it. A repo that
had these workflows before this change keeps `claude-review.yml` /
`claude.yml` (and the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret) under
`.github/workflows/` until someone deletes them by hand, and until
then they still fire on every human-authored PR. Check
`.github/workflows/` before treating a PR as unreviewed-except-magi:
if either file is still there, its comments are a real review, not
noise to ignore.

- **`magi review <branch>`** runs only the review + verification +
  gate half of magi's graph: nothing competes, no implementation, no
  judging, no vote. That is the mode for hand-written work.
  `magi run "<task>"` is the full competition, for work handed over
  whole. Both end at the same gate.
- What the loop actually does: each reviewer gets its **own detached
  worktree pinned at the commit under review** (no reviewer can
  perturb the tree, and the fixer never races one); `verify.e2e` runs
  in the branch's worktree and its output is fed to the fixer;
  finding ids (`R2-1-3`) are assigned by magi, not by the agent, so
  the fixer's adoption report can be matched against them; the loop
  is bounded by `review_rounds`; `verify.gate` must exit 0 before any
  merge is attempted.
- **`magi.toml` is repo-owned, not kata-managed.** Point
  `verify.gate` at the exact command CI runs, so a local pass means a
  green PR, and point `verify.e2e` at the invocation that actually
  covers the repo — feature flags included. A gate that differs from
  CI turns a clean magi run into a red PR, which is the one failure
  this arrangement cannot absorb.
- **If you did not run magi, the change was not reviewed, and nothing
  will tell you.** Do not open a PR for a hand-written change before
  `magi review` comes back clean; if you must, say so in the PR body
  and say why. What does *not* count as a substitute: a green CI run
  (it compiles and tests, it does not review), and CodeRabbit's
  silence.
- **CodeRabbit stays installed and is not part of the gate.** It does
  not auto-review repositories under 10 stars — the common case here —
  so treat it as absent unless it posts. When it does post, its
  findings are a real review: address them, reply **in the inline
  thread** with an `@coderabbitai` mention (the review-comment
  *replies* endpoint,
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments/<id>/replies -f body=…`),
  and reply even when declining — say why, because a silent skip
  reads as overlooked. A "review limit reached" quota notice carries
  no findings and counts as quiet; re-trigger with
  `@coderabbitai review` when the quota refills if you want a real
  pass.
- **Read the report, not the exit status.** A reviewer seat that
  times out is logged as `WARN agent timed out seat=review-2` and
  then summarised as "raised 0 finding(s)" — indistinguishable from a
  genuinely clean pass in both the summary and `magi stats`. Check
  for timeouts before believing a clean round: a round where half the
  panel never answered is not a clean round.
- **Review artifacts stay local.** magi comments on a pull request
  only when it *stops* landing one. Findings, the fixer's adoption
  report and reviewer precision live in the run directory
  (`magi show`, `magi stats`). When the PR needs a record — a
  non-obvious fix, a finding declined with an argument — paste that
  part into the PR body or a comment yourself.
- With `merge = "pr"`, magi opens the pull request and keeps going:
  watches the checks, reads the review comments (human and bot), runs
  a bounded fix round when either is unhappy, pushes, and asks before
  merging. `land_approval` is on by default and **silence is a
  hold** — nothing merges unanswered. `magi answer` (or the web UI)
  is where it asks. Out of rounds leaves the PR open with a comment
  saying what still fails; `checks: unknown` never merges.
- **Merge gate**: magi's gate green — or CI green for a change magi
  never touched — **and** every review that did post resolved (a
  leftover `claude-review.yml`, CodeRabbit, a human) **and** the
  owner's explicit approval. The irreversible step stays a human
  decision.
- **No review-monitoring poll loop for bots this layer no longer
  ships.** The old loop existed to wait on them. Where a repo still
  has `claude-review.yml` (see above) the old cadence still applies
  until it is deleted; otherwise, after opening a PR wait for CI and
  report the wait state to the owner. When magi is landing the PR
  (`land = true`), magi does the watching.
- Bot-authored PRs (Renovate / Dependabot) need no review pass at
  all: CI green + owner approval.
- **Version-bump-only PRs** — a single `chore/release-vX.Y.Z` branch
  whose entire diff is `[workspace.package].version` /
  `[package].version` plus the matching inter-crate refs and the
  lockfile — likewise. There is nothing in a version bump for a
  reviewer to find, and the release pipeline downstream of merge
  (auto-tag → `release.yml`) is time-sensitive.

### Worktree workflow

> **Before your FIRST edit to any file, run `renri add` — NEVER edit the
> main checkout.** Read-only inspection (Read / Grep / Glob) stays on the
> main checkout; the instant you intend to *change* a file, you must
> already be in a worktree. The trap that keeps catching agents: diving
> into a fix the moment the diagnosis lands and editing in place. A
> concurrent agent shares the main checkout — your in-place edits will
> clobber theirs or be clobbered, and in a jj-colocated repo a stray
> working-copy commit entangles unrelated WIP into your branch. If you
> slip and edit in the main checkout, capture the diff first (jj already
> snapshotted it into the working-copy commit, so `jj diff > patch`; for
> git, `git stash` or save a patch — if you got as far as committing on a
> branch, just push it). Then reset the main checkout to pristine main
> (`jj new main@origin`, or `git switch -`), `renri add` a worktree, and
> re-apply the captured diff there.

Use [`renri`](https://github.com/yukimemi/renri) for any
commit-bound change. From the main checkout:

```sh
renri add <branch-name> --from main@origin            # create a worktree (jj-first), off latest upstream main
renri --vcs git add <branch-name> --from origin/main  # force a git worktree, off latest upstream main
renri remove <branch-name> -y --non-interactive  # cleanup after merge (agent-safe; see note)
renri prune                        # GC stale worktrees
```

Read-only inspection can stay on the main checkout.

**Always pass `--from <upstream main>`** (`main@origin` for jj,
`origin/main` for git). Without it, `renri add` forks off the *cwd
worktree's current HEAD* — in a long-lived main checkout that often
lags upstream, so the PR later shows up CONFLICTING against a `main`
that had already moved (e.g. a refactor merged upstream before the
branch was cut), forcing a manual re-port of the whole change.
`renri add` does fetch first, but fetching only updates `main@origin`
— it never moves the checkout's HEAD, so an explicit `--from` is what
guarantees a fresh base.

**Agents / non-interactive shells:** `renri remove` prints a details
panel and waits for a confirmation prompt — without `-y` it **hangs**,
and `--non-interactive` *alone* errors asking for `-y`. Always pass
`-y`, and add `--non-interactive` so a mistyped/omitted name fails
instead of opening a fuzzy picker (the same picker-fallback applies to
`remove` / `cd` / `exec` with no name). Use `-f`/`--force` to remove a
worktree that still has uncommitted changes or conflicts. To sweep
every merged-PR worktree in one shot: `renri remove --merged -y`.

### kata-managed sections

Several files in this repo are managed by `kata apply` from the
[`yukimemi/pj-presets`](https://github.com/yukimemi/pj-presets)
templates — the bytes between `<!-- kata:*:begin -->` and
`<!-- kata:*:end -->` markers, plus the overwrite-always files
listed in `.kata/applied.toml`. **Editing those bytes locally
won't survive the next `kata apply`** — push the change to the
upstream template repo (`yukimemi/pj-base` / `yukimemi/pj-rust` /
…) instead.

The marker scopes are layered, one per applied layer:
`kata:agents:base:*` is this section, and each layer adds its own
(`kata:agents:rust:*`, `kata:agents:rust-cli:*`,
`kata:agents:pnpm:*`, `kata:agents:firebase:*`, …). Which ones apply
*here* is a grep away: `<!-- kata:` in this file.

### This project's own conventions

Everything a layer ships is generic by construction: it describes the
stack the template assumed, not what this repo grew into. **Bytes
outside every marker pair are yours and survive `kata apply`** — so
project-specific conventions belong in a section of their own, outside
the markers (conventionally at the end of the file; if a later layer
appends its block below yours, no matter — kata only ever rewrites
between its own markers). Same mechanism as the `.gitignore` /
`.gitattributes` blocks.

Write those conventions down there rather than leaving them in one
agent's head, in commit archaeology, or in a README the agent will not
read. What earns a line:

- **Any layer default that does not hold here.** A layer states its
  assumption flatly ("Hosting is the primary target", "these rules are
  a placeholder to replace"). When the project has diverged, say so and
  say why — the layer's text keeps asserting the opposite on every
  apply, and an agent that only reads the blocks will act on it.
- **Facts duplicated across files with no compiler in between** — an
  address or a path that appears in code *and* in a rules/config file
  that cannot import it, a timeout that has to stay inside another
  timeout. List every copy, so the next edit finds them all.
- **kata-shipped files this project deleted on purpose**, together with
  the `once_applied = true` line in `.kata/applied.toml` that keeps
  them deleted. Otherwise someone helpfully restores one.
- **Shapes the runtime forces but no tool checks** — an export form a
  platform requires, import specifiers that must (or must not) carry a
  file extension, a directory whose contents are reachable by URL.
- **Invariants that money or access rest on**, naming the file and line
  that actually enforces them.
- **Which language the code speaks versus what a user reads**, when the
  two differ.

A repo whose `AGENTS.md` is nothing but kata blocks is a repo where
every agent re-derives all of that from scratch — and gets the layer
defaults wrong the same way each time.

### Denops plugin workflow

This repo follows the shared Denops plugin conventions. The
language-agnostic conventions block above (`kata:agents:base:*`)
covers git workflow, PR review cycle, and worktree usage.

### Test / lint / format

Tests and lint run through Deno itself:

```sh
deno task ci       # full CI gate (type-check + lint + fmt-check + test)
deno task check    # type-check only
deno task fmt      # format code
deno task lint     # lint
deno task test     # test
```

Deno's built-in formatter (not prettier, not dprint) is the
authoritative formatter. Run `deno fmt` before committing; CI
enforces `deno fmt --check`.

### CI workflow

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is kata-managed. The source lives in
`yukimemi/pj-denops/.github/workflows/ci.yml.tera`. Action versions
are pinned in `.kata/vars.toml` and bumped by Renovate — do not edit
them inline in the workflow; the bump would be clobbered on the next
`kata apply`.

CI installs real Vim and Neovim and exports
`DENOPS_TEST_VIM_EXECUTABLE` / `DENOPS_TEST_NVIM_EXECUTABLE`, because
`@denops/test` spawns the editors as child processes. Editor versions
are pinned in `.kata/vars.toml` under `[denops]`. Do not add a
`shell:` override to the run step — forcing `bash` routes Windows
through Git Bash, which mangles those executable paths and hangs the
nvim cases.

### Dependency updates and merging

Renovate owns every dependency bump, including the Deno / JSR imports in
`deno.json` (its `deno` manager reads `deno.json` and the workspace
members). There is no `deno outdated` cron and no
`pascalgn/automerge-action` workflow — an earlier setup had both, and they
duplicated what Renovate already does.

Merging is GitHub's native auto-merge, armed by Renovate
(`platformAutomerge`) and by pj-base's `kata-apply` / `apm-bump`
workflows via `gh pr merge --auto`. Two repo-side preconditions, both
required — this is the same setup the pj-rust line uses:

* `allow_auto_merge` enabled on the repository.
* Branch protection on `main` with `ci (ubuntu-latest)` as a required
  status check. GitHub only arms auto-merge on a pull request that is
  currently blocked; with no required check the PR is immediately
  mergeable and the request is rejected.

Only the ubuntu leg is required on purpose. The macOS and Windows legs
still run and still have to be read, but a flaky runner on those two
(editor downloads time out often enough) must not wedge every dependency
PR.

Minor and patch bumps merge themselves. Majors wait for a human — that
includes Deno / JSR majors, which the old `deno outdated --latest` cron
used to pull in unreviewed.
